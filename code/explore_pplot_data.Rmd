## Georeferenced tree point locations 

```{r}
# directory containing georeferenced shapefiles at MRS4
input_dir <- "../data/NIWO/tom_mrs04/mrs04_georeferenced_using_unavco_gps_points/"

# the "MRS4point.shp" feature class contains point locations
# for each numbered tree (TreeNum attribute)
mrs4point_layer <- "MRS4point.shp"
mrs4point <- sf::st_read(paste0(input_dir, mrs4point_layer))

# print the number of trees with stem locations in the MRS4point.shp file

  ggtitle("All stem points within MRS4point.shp") + 
  coord_sf()

# The other shapefiles in the input_dir contain sapling measurements. 
# I will focus on the larger trees for now. 
```



```{r filter_treeNum_mrs4point}
# filter the tree point shapefiles for entries with matching tree numbers
# to the main canopy data (h3 == 1 from earlier)
mrs4point_mainCanopy <- mrs4point %>% 
              dplyr::filter(TreeNum %in% mrs4_data_mainCanopy$TreeNum)

# print the number of trees with stem locations and Main Canopy height class

```

```{r newMRSpoint, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# there are no trees that have the Main Canopy height class! 
# so I won't be using this shapefile for now. 

# the "newMRS4point.shp" feature class contains point locations
# for each numbered tree (TreeNum attribute)
mrs4point_layer <- "newMRS4point.shp"


mrs4point <- sf::st_read(paste0(input_dir, mrs4point_layer))

# print the number of trees with stem locations in the MRS4point.shp file
print(paste0("There are ", as.character(length(mrs4point$TreeNum)), 
             " trees in the MRS4point shapefile"))

# plot the tree points
ggplot2::ggplot() + 
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = mrs4point, size = 1, color = "black") + 
  ggtitle("MRS4point.shp") + 
  coord_sf()

# filter the tree point shapefiles for entries with matching tree numbers
# to the main canopy data (h3 == 1 from earlier)
mrs4point_mainCanopy <- mrs4point %>% 
              dplyr::filter(TreeNum %in% mrs4_data_mainCanopy$TreeNum)

print(paste0("There are ", as.character(length(mrs4point_mainCanopy$TreeNum)), 
             " trees in the MRS4point shapefile designated as the Main Canopy height class"))

```


Now that we know which Tree Numbers are designated as the Main Canopy height class and also have stem locations in the shapefile, let's add a taxonID attribute to each point in the shapefile to keep track of its species. 

```{r taxonID_cleaning}
# create a look-up table (LUT) where the first column
# contains the taxonID codes and second column contains correspnding Tree Number.
taxonID_TreeNum_lut <- data.frame(taxonID = mrs4_data_mainCanopy$taxonID, 
                                  TreeNum = as.numeric(mrs4_data_mainCanopy$TreeNum))

# get the indices where the Tree Numbers in the point shapefile 
# match with Tree Numbers in the tree data 
idx <- match(mrs4point_mainCanopy$TreeNum, taxonID_TreeNum_lut$TreeNum)
mrs4point_mainCanopy$taxonID <- taxonID_TreeNum_lut[idx, "taxonID"]

# the species codes are different from the taxonID list used by NEON.
# let's adjust them to be the same. PIEN entries already match.  
# first, remove the factors so the taxonID values can be modified as characters.
mrs4point_mainCanopy$taxonID <- as.character(mrs4point_mainCanopy$taxonID)
mrs4point_mainCanopy$taxonID[mrs4point_mainCanopy$taxonID=="ABLA"] <- "ABLAL"
mrs4point_mainCanopy$taxonID[mrs4point_mainCanopy$taxonID=="PICO"] <- "PICOL"
mrs4point_mainCanopy$taxonID[mrs4point_mainCanopy$taxonID=="PIFL"] <- "PIFL2"

# filter the entries to species in the taxonID list 
# (remove the UNKN species entries)
mrs4point_mainCanopy <- mrs4point_mainCanopy %>% dplyr::filter(taxonID %in% taxonList)

# take another look at the number of trees per taxonID 
plyr::count(mrs4point_mainCanopy, 'taxonID') %>%
  knitr::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover",
                                                  "condensed"),
                            full_width = F,
                            position = "left")
```

Plot the stem points at MRS-04 designated as the Main Canopy height class and color them based on their species (taxon ID). 
```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot() + 
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = mrs4point_mainCanopy, 
                   aes(colour=taxonID),
                   size = 1) + 
  ggtitle("MRS-04 Main Canopy stem points colored by species") + 
  coord_sf() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral")
```

```{r plot_stems_on_rgb}

# read RGB tile that contains the MRS-04 plot
rgb_filename <- "../data/NIWO/rgb/2017_NIWO_1_452000_4432000_image.tif"

rgb_red <- raster::raster(rgb_filename, band = 1) 
rgb_green <- raster::raster(rgb_filename, band = 2) 
rgb_blue <- raster::raster(rgb_filename, band = 3) 
rgb_stack <- raster::stack(rgb_red,rgb_green, rgb_blue)
rgb_cropped <- raster::crop(rgb_stack, as(mrs4point_mainCanopy, 'Spatial'))
raster::plotRGB(rgb_cropped, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)
points(as(mrs4point_mainCanopy, 'Spatial'), pch = 16, cex = 0.5)
```


# Random Forest Classification

In theory, we know the species at each of the point locations in the plot above.
The code below extracts features from the remote sensing data cube and run the random forest classifier to predict species, then compare to the known species. 

```{r}
# read stacked AOP data
stacked_aop_filename <- "../data/NIWO/stacked_aop_data/stacked_aop_data_452000_4432000.rds"
stacked_aop_data <- readRDS(file = stacked_aop_filename)

# convert from SF to Spatial object to use the raster::extract function
mrs4point_mainCanopy_Sp <- sf::as_Spatial(mrs4point_mainCanopy,
                                  IDs = as.character(mrs4point_mainCanopy$TreeNum))


# extract all layers for each pixel in the shapefile
extracted_spectra <- raster::extract(stacked_aop_data, 
                                     mrs4point_mainCanopy_Sp, 
                                     df = TRUE)

extracted_spectra$TreeNum <- mrs4point_mainCanopy_Sp$TreeNum
extracted_spectra$taxonID <- mrs4point_mainCanopy_Sp$taxonID
extracted_spectra$X.1 <- 0
extracted_spectra$X <- 0
extracted_spectra$Y <- 0


# write extracted spectra to file 
extracted_features_filename <- paste0(out_dir, "MRS04_extracted_features.csv")
write.csv(extracted_spectra, 
              file = extracted_features_filename) 


# read text file containing wavelengths

                                           sep="\n",
                                           skip = 1,
                                           col.names = 'wavelength')))
